  <p>
  <span class="firstWord">Bio</span>: My name is Jenny Wu. I am a 15 year-old girl who codes in Pleasanton, CA. I will be a rising junior at Castro Valley High School and my favorite sport is basketball. I love to hang out with my friends in my free time and I'm very sociable so I love meeting new people.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span class="firstWord">Likes</span>: social media, shoes (lightweight a sneakerhead but too broke to afford them), hip-hop & R&B music, hair & makeup, shopping, junk food, boba, and more.
  </p >
  <p>
  <span class="firstWord">Dislikes</span>: Bugs, raw fish, coconuts, avocadoes (I only eat them in guacamole!), cheese (I only eat it if it's melted), and others.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span class="firstWord">Fun Facts</span>: I currently hold an officer position as treasurer in Castro Valley Key Club, I sing in my school choir, and my favorite drink from iTea is a mango fruit tea, 30% ice & 80% sweetness ;)

  <h1> <center> Future Plans </center> </h1>
  <p>
    In about two years, I plan to graduate from Castro Valley High School (go Trojans!) and hopefully attend UCLA. I am still deciding on what I want to pursue as a major, something in the medical or CS field.
